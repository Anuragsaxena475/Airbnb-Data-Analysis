# 🏡 Airbnb Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, and Visualization

## Overview
This project involves working with an Airbnb dataset sourced from Kaggle.  
The goal is to **clean, preprocess, and visualize** the dataset to uncover insights about listings, pricing, availability, reviews, and more.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains **102,599** entries with **26 features**, including:
- Listing details (name, room type, price, etc.)
- Host information (host ID, host name, verification status)
- Location details (neighbourhood, country, latitude, longitude)
- Reviews and ratings
- Availability and construction year

> Some columns contain missing values which are handled during preprocessing.

## Libraries Used
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for static data visualization
- **Plotly Express** for interactive visualizations

## Tasks Performed
- 📋 **Data Cleaning:**  
  - Handled missing values
  - Corrected data types
  - Removed unnecessary columns
  - Fixed inconsistencies in textual data

- 🛠️ **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Converted price and service fee to numeric
  - Dealt with outliers in numerical columns

- 📊 **Data Visualization:**  
  - Distribution of prices across neighbourhoods
  - Room type comparison
  - Host activity analysis
  - Review trends over months
  - Availability patterns
  - Interactive maps showing geographical data
  - 
## Future Scope
- Build predictive models (e.g., predicting price based on features)
- Deep dive into review sentiment analysis
- Time-series analysis for availability and booking trends
